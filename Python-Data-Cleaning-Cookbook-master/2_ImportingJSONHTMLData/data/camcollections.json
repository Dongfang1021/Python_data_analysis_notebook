His career, now spanning seven decades, has been devoted to documenting African-American life and history, from everyday scenes to the universal struggle for freedom, social justice, and human dignity. Moving to Harlem as a teenager in 1930, Lawrence was influenced by the artists, writers, and philosophers of the Harlem Renaissance-among them Romare Bearden, Langston Hughes, and W.E.B. DuBois-who fostered pride in African-American culture. Lawrence's subjects include the legendary abolitionist heroes Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and John Brown, and the story of the massive migration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrialized, urban North during the early decades of the 20th century. After thorough research, Lawrence chronicles the crucial events of each saga by creating a series of small paintings on paper in a modernist style of flat, brightly-colored forms.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1917", "death_year": "2000"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "tempera on Masonite", "support_materials": [], "department": "American Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "American - Painting", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Unframed: 60.9 x 76.2 cm (24 x 30 in.)", "dimensions": {"unframed": {"height": 0.609, "width": 0.762}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Mr. and Mrs. William H.

Sall\u00e9e worked on several Works Progress Administration projects, 1936 creating prints, then painting murals. His WPA commissions included work for Sunny Acres Hospital, the Outhwaite Homes, and Cleveland Municipal Airport, as well as the Fort Hays Homes in Columbus, Ohio. He exhibited in the May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1935\u201346), and in group exhibitions at Howard University (1937) and the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. (1940), the Tanner Art Galleries of Chicago (1940), the Associated American Art Galleries of New York (1941), and Atlanta University (1942). The North Canton Library in Canton, Ohio, organized his first solo exhibition in 1940. He was drafted into the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II and worked as a cartographer and camouflage designer. After the war, he began a career in interior design. For the next four decades, Sall\u00e9e worked for various interior design firms in Cleveland, designing corporate offices, nightclubs, hotels, and restaurants for such clients as Cleveland Trust, Stouffer Hotel, and the Cleveland Browns. <br><em>Transformations in Cleveland Art.</em> (CMA, 1996), p. 236", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1911", "death_year": "2006"}], "culture": ["America, Ohio, Cleveland, 20th century"], "technique": "oil on canvas", "support_materials": [], "department": "American Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "American - Cleveland School", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Framed: 86.4 x 66 cm (34 x 26 in.); Unframed: 79 x 66.2 cm (31 1/8 x 26 1/16 in.)", "dimensions": {"framed": {"height": 0.864, "width": 0.66}, "unframed": {"height": 0.79, "width": 0.662}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of June Sallee Antoine in honor of our parents, Charles Louis Sallee, Sr. and Cora Nell Collier Sallee", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [{"inscription": "Signed lower left corner: \"Sall\u00e9e\"", "inscription_translation": null, "inscription_remark": null}], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "Hardship to Hope: African American Art from the Karamu Workshop", "description": "<i>Hardship to Hope: African American Art from the Karamu Workshop</i>.

Experimenting with Cubist-derived ideas, he developed flat, shallow planes of space punctured by the precipitously tipped table in the foreground, shifting the point of view.

He moved to Cleveland in 1925 with his mother, a singer who recognized her son's talent and enrolled him in Saturday-morning classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art. While in high school, he took life-drawing classes at the Huntington Polytechnic Institute. After attending classes at the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts, 1933-34, he studied with Carl Gaertner and Rolf Stoll at the Cleveland School of Art, graduating in 1938. During this period Lee-Smith taught drawing at Karamu House, then known as the Playhouse Settlement. For financial reasons he declined a fifth-year scholarship from the Cleveland School of Art in 1938 and began working for the Works Progress Administration's Ohio Art Project, where he learned lithography and etching. He exhibited in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1937-41). In 1939 he became a board member of the magazine \"Crossroads\" and later that year received a one-year appointment to teach art at Claflin College in South Carolina. In 1940 he cofounded Karamu Artists Incorporated and served as the organization's president. In the early 1940s he moved to Detroit, the hometown of his new wife. After serving in the navy during World War II, he returned to Detroit and attended Wayne University, where he earned a B. S. in education in 1953. He exhibited steadily throughout the 1940s and 1950s, showing at galleries in Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. In 1957 he won the prestigious Emily Lowe Award from the National Academy of Design and soon after moved to New York. In 1967 he was elected a full-member of the National Academy of Design and began teaching there in 1972. In 1988 the Malcolm Brown Gallery in Cleveland mounted a solo exhibition of his work, and later that year the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton organized a retrospective. Lee-Smith lives and works in New Jersey. <br> \"Transformations in Cleveland Art (CMA, 1996), p. 233", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1915", "death_year": "1999"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "oil on masonite", "support_materials": [], "department": "American Painting and Sculpture", "collection": "American - Painting", "type": "Painting", "measurements": "Unframed: 61 x 63.5 cm (24 x 25 in.)", "dimensions": {"unframed": {"height": 0.61, "width": 0.635}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Purchase from the J.

His images often incorporate sacrosanct icons along with psychologically and morally charged substances such as blood, sperm, urine, and milk. The technically accomplished color photographs embalm the subjects in an aura of artifice, addressing the tension in late 20th-century America between spirituality and commercialism.\r\n\tSerrano (born in New York City) attended the Brooklyn Museum Art School (1967\u201369) and worked in an advertising firm before deciding in the early 1980s to enter full-time New York's politically charged art scene. Later in the decade, working under the auspices of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Serrano gained international attention as the target of attacks from politicians and religious leaders who took offense to his photograph Piss Christ (1987), which depicts a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine. The debate over the image's \"blasphemous\" nature epitomized the virulent relationship between conservatives and politically active artists during a period fraught with contentions that continue to the present day regarding definitions of art and pornography and the dispensation of federal arts funding.\r\n\tSerrano continues to examine charged subject matter. His series include KKK Portraits (1991), Morgue (1992), and Objects of Desire (1994-95). In addition to his controversial nea fellowship, Serrano has garnered awards from the National Studio Program at P.S. 1 (1985), the New York Foundation for the Arts (1987), the Cintas Foundation (1989), and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation (1989).

She began making traditional documentary photographs throughout the United States and Africa in the late 1970s. While in graduate school at the University of California, San Diego (M.F.A., 1985), Simpson began to question and challenge the objectivity of such images and to examine the ways in which these documents are generally perceived. Taking subjects from her own photographs and inserting them into stark backgrounds, she eliminated their contextual clues and instead juxtaposed her own texts and readings, often revealing racial and gender prejudices otherwise subsumed. In the mid-1980s, Simpson won international attention and critical acclaim for her series of large-scale black-and-white self-portraits. Photographing herself from the back, excluding her face and often juxtaposing the portrait with text and appropriated imagery, Simpson used her absence of self to comment on the exclusion of African Americans in history and culture. She continues to address these issues. Since 1990 Simpson has completed three related series, incorporating her back-turned or effaced self-portrait with symbolic props such as coiled or braided hair, high-heeled shoes, and African masks. Simpson (born in New York City) has received many awards and exhibited internationally. In 1990 she was the first African-American woman to be given a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She has also been included in the Venice Biennale (1990) and the Whitney Biennial Exhibition (1991, 1993). Simpson lives in Brooklyn.

Writer, musician, film director, and photographer Gordon Alexander Buchanan Parks (born in Fort Scott, Kansas) has been particularly influential in the arenas of photojournalism and documentary photography. A self-taught photographer, Parks became seriously interested in the medium in 1937 upon seeing images made for the Farm Security Administration. Roy Stryker, who headed the fsa photography program, later hired him for several assignments (1942-43). Parks went on to work as an information correspondent during World War II and worked for Stryker on the Standard Oil of New Jersey photography project from 1945-48. He was a staff photographer for Life magazine (1948-61) and the editorial director of Essence magazine (1970-73). His coverage of the Black Muslim movement of the 1960s, his portraits of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, and his story on Flavio da Silva, a poverty-stricken Brazilian boy, testify to the power and compassion of his images. Parks has received many prestigious awards, including a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship (1942), an award from the National Council for Christians and Jews (1964), the Frederic W. Brehm Award (1962), the Carr Van Adna Journalism Award, Ohio University (1970), and the Spingarn Medal, the naacp's highest honor (1972). In 1967 Nikon named Parks as the photographer and writer who had done the most to promote worldwide understanding. He holds 14 honorary degrees. Parks has also worked in color, primarily for his more artistic book projects, including Gordon Parks: Whispers of Intimate Things (1971) and A Poet and his Camera (1968). His films include Shaft (1972), Leadbelly (1976), The Super Crops (1974), and his most widely recognized, The Learning Tree (1969), for which he wrote the screen adaptation of his own novel and composed the musical score.

His images of his native New York -- street scenes and children, family, and friends in Harlem -- exhibit both critical insight and compassion. A series of portraits of jazz musicians (begun in 1956) includes Lester Young, John Coltrane, and Billie Holiday. DeCarava also has worked for many commercial periodicals, including Fortune, Harper's, Sports Illustrated, Look, Newsweek, Time, and Life. After graduating from high school in 1938, DeCarava began working in the poster division of the Works Progress Administration during the day and attending night classes at Cooper Union. He studied drawing and printmaking at the Harlem Art Center (1940-42), continuing at George Washington Carver Art School, where Charles White was his teacher (1944-45). DeCarava began to photograph in 1946 as a means to visualize ideas for his paintings, committing full-time to the medium one year later. In 1950 he had his first solo exhibition at Forty-Fourth Street Gallery. The same year he made his first print sales to Edward Steichen, director of the photography department of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Two years later, DeCarava was awarded a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the first given to a black artist and the ninth awarded to a photographer. DeCarava directed A Photographer's Gallery (1954-56), one of the first spaces dedicated to promoting photography as a fine art. In 1955 he collaborated with writer Langston Hughes on one of his most acclaimed projects, the book The Sweet Flypaper of Life (reprinted 1967). Never one to work in isolation, DeCarava has been a community organizer, curator and gallery director, and political activist throughout his career, receiving numerous honors for artistic achievement, community outreach, and contributions to African-American communities. He has taught photography at Cooper Union (1969-72) and Hunter College (1975-present), and has had more than 15 one-person exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (1975), the Studio Museum, Harlem (1983), and the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1996).

Born in Chattanooga, Smith moved to Cleveland at the age of 13 and became involved with Karamu House, learning print making and stage design. He studied art at the Huntington Polytechnic Institute, 1933\u201334. During this time he began teaching at Karamu House and continued to do so until 1940. In 1941 he won the art competition for presenting one of his prints to the Library of Congress for its permanent collection. Smith exhibited at the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts in Hartford (1935), in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1936\u2013 49), at the Associated American Artists Galleries of New York (1942), and at Atlanta University (1942). During World War II, he served as a photographer in the army\u2019s educational department. After the war, he returned to Cleveland and established a commercial silkscreening studio. In 1946 the Lyman Brothers\u2019 Gallery in Indianapolis mounted his first solo exhibition. From 1946 to 1948 he studied painting and printmaking at the Cleveland School of Art and the Cooper School of Art. In the late 1940s Smith moved to Los Angeles, where he associated with Curtis Tann, a former colleague from Karamu House. With Tann, Smith cofounded the Eleven Associated Artists Gallery, the first Los Angeles gallery devoted specifically to African art. In 1952 Smith was hired to work as a blueprint draftsman at Lockheed Aircraft, beginning a long association with the corporation.

Writer, musician, film director, and photographer Gordon Alexander Buchanan Parks (born in Fort Scott, Kansas) has been particularly influential in the arenas of photojournalism and documentary photography. A self-taught photographer, Parks became seriously interested in the medium in 1937 upon seeing images made for the Farm Security Administration. Roy Stryker, who headed the fsa photography program, later hired him for several assignments (1942-43). Parks went on to work as an information correspondent during World War II and worked for Stryker on the Standard Oil of New Jersey photography project from 1945-48. He was a staff photographer for Life magazine (1948-61) and the editorial director of Essence magazine (1970-73). His coverage of the Black Muslim movement of the 1960s, his portraits of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, and his story on Flavio da Silva, a poverty-stricken Brazilian boy, testify to the power and compassion of his images. Parks has received many prestigious awards, including a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship (1942), an award from the National Council for Christians and Jews (1964), the Frederic W. Brehm Award (1962), the Carr Van Adna Journalism Award, Ohio University (1970), and the Spingarn Medal, the naacp's highest honor (1972). In 1967 Nikon named Parks as the photographer and writer who had done the most to promote worldwide understanding. He holds 14 honorary degrees. Parks has also worked in color, primarily for his more artistic book projects, including Gordon Parks: Whispers of Intimate Things (1971) and A Poet and his Camera (1968). His films include Shaft (1972), Leadbelly (1976), The Super Crops (1974), and his most widely recognized, The Learning Tree (1969), for which he wrote the screen adaptation of his own novel and composed the musical score. He has had one-person exhibitions throughout the United States, including the Art Institute of Chicago (1953), the Baltimore Museum of Art (1984), and the Laguna Gloria Art Museum, Austin (1985).", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1912", "death_year": "2006"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "gelatin silver print", "support_materials": [], "department": "Photography", "collection": "PH - American 1951-Present", "type": "Photograph", "measurements": "Image: 16.2 x 24 cm (6 3/8 x 9 7/16 in.); Paper: 20.4 x 25.2 cm (8 1/16 x 9 15/16 in.); Matted: 40.6 x 50.8 cm (16 x 20 in.)", "dimensions": {"image": {"height": 0.162, "width": 0.24}, "paper": {"height": 0.204, "width": 0.252}, "matted": {"height": 0.406, "width": 0.508}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "John L.

She began making traditional documentary photographs throughout the United States and Africa in the late 1970s. While in graduate school at the University of California, San Diego (M.F.A., 1985), Simpson began to question and challenge the objectivity of such images and to examine the ways in which these documents are generally perceived. Taking subjects from her own photographs and inserting them into stark backgrounds, she eliminated their contextual clues and instead juxtaposed her own texts and readings, often revealing racial and gender prejudices otherwise subsumed. In the mid-1980s, Simpson won international attention and critical acclaim for her series of large-scale black-and-white self-portraits. Photographing herself from the back, excluding her face and often juxtaposing the portrait with text and appropriated imagery, Simpson used her absence of self to comment on the exclusion of African Americans in history and culture. She continues to address these issues. Since 1990 Simpson has completed three related series, incorporating her back-turned or effaced self-portrait with symbolic props such as coiled or braided hair, high-heeled shoes, and African masks. Simpson (born in New York City) has received many awards and exhibited internationally. In 1990 she was the first African-American woman to be given a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She has also been included in the Venice Biennale (1990) and the Whitney Biennial Exhibition (1991, 1993). Simpson lives in Brooklyn.

Writer, musician, film director, and photographer Gordon Alexander Buchanan Parks (born in Fort Scott, Kansas) has been particularly influential in the arenas of photojournalism and documentary photography. A self-taught photographer, Parks became seriously interested in the medium in 1937 upon seeing images made for the Farm Security Administration. Roy Stryker, who headed the fsa photography program, later hired him for several assignments (1942-43). Parks went on to work as an information correspondent during World War II and worked for Stryker on the Standard Oil of New Jersey photography project from 1945-48. He was a staff photographer for Life magazine (1948-61) and the editorial director of Essence magazine (1970-73). His coverage of the Black Muslim movement of the 1960s, his portraits of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, and his story on Flavio da Silva, a poverty-stricken Brazilian boy, testify to the power and compassion of his images. Parks has received many prestigious awards, including a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship (1942), an award from the National Council for Christians and Jews (1964), the Frederic W. Brehm Award (1962), the Carr Van Adna Journalism Award, Ohio University (1970), and the Spingarn Medal, the naacp's highest honor (1972). In 1967 Nikon named Parks as the photographer and writer who had done the most to promote worldwide understanding. He holds 14 honorary degrees. Parks has also worked in color, primarily for his more artistic book projects, including Gordon Parks: Whispers of Intimate Things (1971) and A Poet and his Camera (1968). His films include Shaft (1972), Leadbelly (1976), The Super Crops (1974), and his most widely recognized, The Learning Tree (1969), for which he wrote the screen adaptation of his own novel and composed the musical score. He has had one-person exhibitions throughout the United States, including the Art Institute of Chicago (1953), the Baltimore Museum of Art (1984), and the Laguna Gloria Art Museum, Austin (1985).", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1912", "death_year": "2006"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "gelatin silver print", "support_materials": [], "department": "Photography", "collection": "PH - American 1951-Present", "type": "Photograph", "measurements": "Image: 22.9 x 33.7 cm (9 x 13 1/4 in.); Paper: 23.3 x 34 cm (9 3/16 x 13 3/8 in.); Matted: 45.7 x 55.9 cm (18 x 22 in.)", "dimensions": {"image": {"height": 0.229, "width": 0.337}, "paper": {"height": 0.233, "width": 0.34}, "matted": {"height": 0.457, "width": 0.559}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Norman O.

Since that time he has lectured, curated, and exhibited throughout the United States, completed a number of public commissions, and taught in the Los Angeles area. Middlebrook draws inspiration from his family and roots, which he credits for his drive and ideals. Using a complex developing technique to create dense, multitoned, painterly images, he conveys the notion of an eroding cultural identity in his large-scale portraits of friends and family begun in the mid-1980s. In 1996 the Cleveland Museum of Art held a one-person exhibition of the series, Willie Robert Middlebrook Photographs: Portraits of My People. Middlebrook has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1982, 1993) and commendations from the city of Los Angeles (1987, 1989, 1991), and in 1988 was named \"Hometown Hero\" by the city of Compton.

Writer, musician, film director, and photographer Gordon Alexander Buchanan Parks (born in Fort Scott, Kansas) has been particularly influential in the arenas of photojournalism and documentary photography. A self-taught photographer, Parks became seriously interested in the medium in 1937 upon seeing images made for the Farm Security Administration. Roy Stryker, who headed the fsa photography program, later hired him for several assignments (1942-43). Parks went on to work as an information correspondent during World War II and worked for Stryker on the Standard Oil of New Jersey photography project from 1945-48. He was a staff photographer for Life magazine (1948-61) and the editorial director of Essence magazine (1970-73). His coverage of the Black Muslim movement of the 1960s, his portraits of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, and his story on Flavio da Silva, a poverty-stricken Brazilian boy, testify to the power and compassion of his images. Parks has received many prestigious awards, including a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship (1942), an award from the National Council for Christians and Jews (1964), the Frederic W. Brehm Award (1962), the Carr Van Adna Journalism Award, Ohio University (1970), and the Spingarn Medal, the naacp's highest honor (1972). In 1967 Nikon named Parks as the photographer and writer who had done the most to promote worldwide understanding. He holds 14 honorary degrees. Parks has also worked in color, primarily for his more artistic book projects, including Gordon Parks: Whispers of Intimate Things (1971) and A Poet and his Camera (1968). His films include Shaft (1972), Leadbelly (1976), The Super Crops (1974), and his most widely recognized, The Learning Tree (1969), for which he wrote the screen adaptation of his own novel and composed the musical score.

Born in Pittsburgh, Brown moved to Columbus, Ohio, at an early age. After a series of family disruptions, the teenaged Brown became a vagrant. During his wanderings, he began to draw thing, with a piece of coal, a pencil stub, or chalk, on sidewalks, walls, or freight car doors. In 1924 he was put on a chain gang for illegally riding freight trains, an experience that gave him a \u201csudden and harsh maturing\u201d. After moving to Cleveland in 1929, he associated with the art and theater departments of Karamu House, working as an actor and stage designer. He attended the Huntington Polytechnic Institute in Cleveland, 1933\u201334, on a Gilpin Players scholarship supplied by Karamu. Brown exhibited in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1934\u201343). In 1936 he joined the Cleveland theater project of the Works Progress Administration, working in scenic design. He later worked in the departments of graphic arts and sculpture-ceramics of the WPA. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, under the auspices of the WPA Ohio Art Project, Brown painted three murals for Valleyview Homes in Cleveland, a federal housing project. He exhibited with other Karamu House artists in New York City and Philadelphia (1942).

He also photographed Harlem's celebrated artists, writers, singers, religious leaders, and politicians.\r\n\tIn 1924 VanDerZee became official photographer for Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association, documenting their conventions, rallies, and parades.

His career, now spanning seven decades, has been devoted to documenting African-American life and history, from everyday scenes to the universal struggle for freedom, social justice, and human dignity. Moving to Harlem as a teenager in 1930, Lawrence was influenced by the artists, writers, and philosophers of the Harlem Renaissance-among them Romare Bearden, Langston Hughes, and W.E.B.

Johnson's work changed dramatically. He began using African Americans as subjects, explaining that \"I want to paint Negro people in their natural environment . . . I wish to study my people thoroughly.\" \n\nJohnson acknowledged the innate power and spirituality found in the art of common people and decided to exploit his own folk heritage, returning visually to the South of his childhood.

Shooting mostly in Harlem and around New York, Draper created reflective and penetrating portraits, compelling street photography, and, later in life, abstractions. Although Draper rarely commented on individual photographs, he wrote and spoke about the impact he felt he could make through photography. The profession caused him to \u201crealize that what I felt had worth; that I could make strong statements about the world in visual terms and that often these images did in fact move people emotionally. I had power . . . [that] was given to me for the purpose of sharing.\u201d Seeking an ongoing forum for dialogue with other photographers, in 1963 Draper co-founded Kamoinge, an important collective of African American photographers that continues to this day in Harlem. Among the group\u2019s concerns was to try to define a black aesthetic in photography. Draper proposed in 1972 that it would require \u201can investigation into the nature of what it means to be black, and a translation of that into optical terms.\u201d", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1935", "death_year": "2002"}], "culture": [], "technique": "gelatin silver print", "support_materials": [], "department": "Photography", "collection": "PH - American 1951-Present", "type": "Photograph", "measurements": "Image: 31.1 x 20.7 cm (12 1/4 x 8 1/8 in.); Paper: 35.4 x 27.6 cm (13 15/16 x 10 7/8 in.)", "dimensions": {"image": {"height": 0.311, "width": 0.207}, "paper": {"height": 0.354, "width": 0.276}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Alma Kroeger Fund", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [{"inscription": "Stamped in black ink on verso: \u201cWARNING: FROM THE ESTATE OF/LOUIS DRAPER/EXECUTOR/NELL DRAPER WINSTON/\u00a9 COPYRIGHT 2002/107 LIBERTY AVENUE/RICHMOND, VA 23223\u201d", "inscription_translation": null, "inscription_remark": null}, {"inscription": "Written in pencil on verso: \u201cLD124\u201d", "inscription_translation": null, "inscription_remark": null}], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "Recent Acquisitions", "description": "<i>Recent Acquisitions</i>.

His images often incorporate sacrosanct icons along with psychologically and morally charged substances such as blood, sperm, urine, and milk. The technically accomplished color photographs embalm the subjects in an aura of artifice, addressing the tension in late 20th-century America between spirituality and commercialism.\r\n\tSerrano (born in New York City) attended the Brooklyn Museum Art School (1967\u201369) and worked in an advertising firm before deciding in the early 1980s to enter full-time New York's politically charged art scene. Later in the decade, working under the auspices of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Serrano gained international attention as the target of attacks from politicians and religious leaders who took offense to his photograph Piss Christ (1987), which depicts a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine. The debate over the image's \"blasphemous\" nature epitomized the virulent relationship between conservatives and politically active artists during a period fraught with contentions that continue to the present day regarding definitions of art and pornography and the dispensation of federal arts funding.\r\n\tSerrano continues to examine charged subject matter. His series include KKK Portraits (1991), Morgue (1992), and Objects of Desire (1994-95).

She began making traditional documentary photographs throughout the United States and Africa in the late 1970s. While in graduate school at the University of California, San Diego (M.F.A., 1985), Simpson began to question and challenge the objectivity of such images and to examine the ways in which these documents are generally perceived. Taking subjects from her own photographs and inserting them into stark backgrounds, she eliminated their contextual clues and instead juxtaposed her own texts and readings, often revealing racial and gender prejudices otherwise subsumed. In the mid-1980s, Simpson won international attention and critical acclaim for her series of large-scale black-and-white self-portraits. Photographing herself from the back, excluding her face and often juxtaposing the portrait with text and appropriated imagery, Simpson used her absence of self to comment on the exclusion of African Americans in history and culture. She continues to address these issues. Since 1990 Simpson has completed three related series, incorporating her back-turned or effaced self-portrait with symbolic props such as coiled or braided hair, high-heeled shoes, and African masks. Simpson (born in New York City) has received many awards and exhibited internationally. In 1990 she was the first African-American woman to be given a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She has also been included in the Venice Biennale (1990) and the Whitney Biennial Exhibition (1991, 1993). Simpson lives in Brooklyn.

This drawing is closely related to Johnson's 1938 lithograph <em>White and Black</em>, a work influenced by Cubism featuring a standing African American woman, her head in profile, holding a strand of beads. The drawing is a truncated version of this composition, with the same head in profile and similar forms, including beads and coils, but the figure is less evident and the overall effect is more abstract.

From 1912-15 VanDerZee operated a portrait studio in the Toussaint Conservatory of Art and Music, established by his sister Jennie.\r\n\tTwo years later VanDerZee opened a studio in Harlem and began making his memorable portraits. During the period of his greatest success, from the years of the Harlem Renaissance (1919-29) until World War II, he photographed the area's large African-American middle class, producing formal portraits of individuals, families, church and school groups, athletic organizations, women's clubs, fraternal organizations, weddings, funerals, and street scenes. He also photographed Harlem's celebrated artists, writers, singers, religious leaders, and politicians.\r\n\tIn 1924 VanDerZee became official photographer for Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association, documenting their conventions, rallies, and parades.

Born in Chattanooga, Smith moved to Cleveland at the age of 13 and became involved with Karamu House, learning print making and stage design. He studied art at the Huntington Polytechnic Institute, 1933\u201334. During this time he began teaching at Karamu House and continued to do so until 1940. In 1941 he won the art competition for presenting one of his prints to the Library of Congress for its permanent collection. Smith exhibited at the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts in Hartford (1935), in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1936\u2013 49), at the Associated American Artists Galleries of New York (1942), and at Atlanta University (1942). During World War II, he served as a photographer in the army\u2019s educational department. After the war, he returned to Cleveland and established a commercial silkscreening studio. In 1946 the Lyman Brothers\u2019 Gallery in Indianapolis mounted his first solo exhibition. From 1946 to 1948 he studied painting and printmaking at the Cleveland School of Art and the Cooper School of Art. In the late 1940s Smith moved to Los Angeles, where he associated with Curtis Tann, a former colleague from Karamu House. With Tann, Smith cofounded the Eleven Associated Artists Gallery, the first Los Angeles gallery devoted specifically to African art. In 1952 Smith was hired to work as a blueprint draftsman at Lockheed Aircraft, beginning a long association with the corporation. In 1960 he cofounded Art West Associated, an African-American artists\u2019 advocacy organization in Los Angeles. In 1970 he published illustrations of subjects from African-American history for Cleveland\u2019s New Day Press.

She began making traditional documentary photographs throughout the United States and Africa in the late 1970s. While in graduate school at the University of California, San Diego (M.F.A., 1985), Simpson began to question and challenge the objectivity of such images and to examine the ways in which these documents are generally perceived. Taking subjects from her own photographs and inserting them into stark backgrounds, she eliminated their contextual clues and instead juxtaposed her own texts and readings, often revealing racial and gender prejudices otherwise subsumed. In the mid-1980s, Simpson won international attention and critical acclaim for her series of large-scale black-and-white self-portraits. Photographing herself from the back, excluding her face and often juxtaposing the portrait with text and appropriated imagery, Simpson used her absence of self to comment on the exclusion of African Americans in history and culture. She continues to address these issues. Since 1990 Simpson has completed three related series, incorporating her back-turned or effaced self-portrait with symbolic props such as coiled or braided hair, high-heeled shoes, and African masks. Simpson (born in New York City) has received many awards and exhibited internationally. In 1990 she was the first African-American woman to be given a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She has also been included in the Venice Biennale (1990) and the Whitney Biennial Exhibition (1991, 1993). Simpson lives in Brooklyn.

Born in Chattanooga, Smith moved to Cleveland at the age of 13 and became involved with Karamu House, learning print making and stage design. He studied art at the Huntington Polytechnic Institute, 1933\u201334. During this time he began teaching at Karamu House and continued to do so until 1940. In 1941 he won the art competition for presenting one of his prints to the Library of Congress for its permanent collection. Smith exhibited at the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts in Hartford (1935), in the annual May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1936\u2013 49), at the Associated American Artists Galleries of New York (1942), and at Atlanta University (1942). During World War II, he served as a photographer in the army\u2019s educational department. After the war, he returned to Cleveland and established a commercial silkscreening studio. In 1946 the Lyman Brothers\u2019 Gallery in Indianapolis mounted his first solo exhibition. From 1946 to 1948 he studied painting and printmaking at the Cleveland School of Art and the Cooper School of Art. In the late 1940s Smith moved to Los Angeles, where he associated with Curtis Tann, a former colleague from Karamu House. With Tann, Smith cofounded the Eleven Associated Artists Gallery, the first Los Angeles gallery devoted specifically to African art. In 1952 Smith was hired to work as a blueprint draftsman at Lockheed Aircraft, beginning a long association with the corporation. In 1960 he cofounded Art West Associated, an African-American artists\u2019 advocacy organization in Los Angeles. In 1970 he published illustrations of subjects from African-American history for Cleveland\u2019s New Day Press. Smith\u2019 s works were displayed ins numerous group exhibitions in the Los Angeles area (1960s\u201380s).<br><em>Transformations in Cleveland Art.</em> (CMA, 1996), p. 238", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1913", "death_year": "1997"}], "culture": ["America, Ohio, Cleveland School, 20th century"], "technique": "linoleum cut", "support_materials": [], "department": "Prints", "collection": "PR - Linocut", "type": "Print", "measurements": null, "dimensions": {}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of The Print Club of Cleveland", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [], "exhibitions": {"current": [{"title": "The May Show: 19th Annual Exhibition of Works by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen", "description": "<i>The May Show: 19th Annual Exhibition of Works by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen</i>.

Writer, musician, film director, and photographer Gordon Alexander Buchanan Parks (born in Fort Scott, Kansas) has been particularly influential in the arenas of photojournalism and documentary photography. A self-taught photographer, Parks became seriously interested in the medium in 1937 upon seeing images made for the Farm Security Administration. Roy Stryker, who headed the fsa photography program, later hired him for several assignments (1942-43). Parks went on to work as an information correspondent during World War II and worked for Stryker on the Standard Oil of New Jersey photography project from 1945-48. He was a staff photographer for Life magazine (1948-61) and the editorial director of Essence magazine (1970-73). His coverage of the Black Muslim movement of the 1960s, his portraits of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, and his story on Flavio da Silva, a poverty-stricken Brazilian boy, testify to the power and compassion of his images. Parks has received many prestigious awards, including a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship (1942), an award from the National Council for Christians and Jews (1964), the Frederic W. Brehm Award (1962), the Carr Van Adna Journalism Award, Ohio University (1970), and the Spingarn Medal, the naacp's highest honor (1972). In 1967 Nikon named Parks as the photographer and writer who had done the most to promote worldwide understanding. He holds 14 honorary degrees. Parks has also worked in color, primarily for his more artistic book projects, including Gordon Parks: Whispers of Intimate Things (1971) and A Poet and his Camera (1968). His films include Shaft (1972), Leadbelly (1976), The Super Crops (1974), and his most widely recognized, The Learning Tree (1969), for which he wrote the screen adaptation of his own novel and composed the musical score. He has had one-person exhibitions throughout the United States, including the Art Institute of Chicago (1953), the Baltimore Museum of Art (1984), and the Laguna Gloria Art Museum, Austin (1985).", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1912", "death_year": "2006"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "gelatin silver print", "support_materials": [], "department": "Photography", "collection": "PH - American 1900-1950", "type": "Photograph", "measurements": "Image: 23.3 x 24 cm (9 3/16 x 9 7/16 in.); Paper: 28.2 x 23.5 cm (11 1/8 x 9 1/4 in.)", "dimensions": {"image": {"height": 0.233, "width": 0.24}, "paper": {"height": 0.282, "width": 0.235}, "mat size": {"height": 0.356, "width": 0.457}}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of George Stephanopoulos", "copyright": "Courtesy and copyright the Gordon Parks Foundation", "inscriptions": [{"inscription": "Xerox of paper label taped to interior of mat: \"28948/Parks Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Sept.

Moving to Harlem as a teenager in 1930, Lawrence was influenced by the artists, writers, and philosophers of the Harlem Renaissance-among them Romare Bearden, Langston Hughes, and W.E.B. DuBois-who fostered pride in African-American culture. Lawrence's subjects include the legendary abolitionist heroes Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and John Brown, and the story of the massive migration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrialized, urban North during the early decades of the 20th century. After thorough research, Lawrence chronicles the crucial events of each saga by creating a series of small paintings on paper in a modernist style of flat, brightly-colored forms.", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1917", "death_year": "2000"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "screenprint", "support_materials": [], "department": "Prints", "collection": "PR - Screenprint", "type": "Print", "measurements": null, "dimensions": {}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of the Lorillard Tobacco Co, NY", "copyright": "\u00a9 Estate of Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York", "inscriptions": [], "exhibitions": {"current": [], "legacy": []}, "provenance": [], "find_spot": null, "related_works": [], "fun_fact": null, "digital_description": null, "wall_description": null, "citations": [], "catalogue_raisonne": "Nesbett L74-3", "url": "https://clevelandart.org/art/1976.1000.5", "images": null, "updated_at": "2019-11-18 11:28:46.534000"}, {"id": 150567, "accession_number": "1982.1011", "share_license_status": "Copyrighted", "tombstone": "Two Generations, 1979.

In 1931 he moved to Cleveland and attended art classes at Karamu House, then known as the Playhouse Settlement. He studied lithography and etching techniques at the Huntington Poly technic Institute, 1932\u201333. He attended the Cleveland School of Art, 1933\u201338, studying with Carl Gaertner, Viktor Schreckengost, Rolf Stoll, and Paul Travis. In 1939 he earned a B.S. in education from Western Reserve College and began teaching art in the Cleveland school system. In 1936 he joined the local chapter of the American Artists\u2019 Congress. Sall\u00e9e worked on several Works Progress Administration projects, 1936 creating prints, then painting murals. His WPA commissions included work for Sunny Acres Hospital, the Outhwaite Homes, and Cleveland Municipal Airport, as well as the Fort Hays Homes in Columbus, Ohio. He exhibited in the May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1935\u201346), and in group exhibitions at Howard University (1937) and the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. (1940), the Tanner Art Galleries of Chicago (1940), the Associated American Art Galleries of New York (1941), and Atlanta University (1942). The North Canton Library in Canton, Ohio, organized his first solo exhibition in 1940. He was drafted into the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II and worked as a cartographer and camouflage designer. After the war, he began a career in interior design. For the next four decades, Sall\u00e9e worked for various interior design firms in Cleveland, designing corporate offices, nightclubs, hotels, and restaurants for such clients as Cleveland Trust, Stouffer Hotel, and the Cleveland Browns. <br><em>Transformations in Cleveland Art.</em> (CMA, 1996), p. 236", "name_in_original_language": null, "birth_year": "1911", "death_year": "2006"}], "culture": ["America, 20th century"], "technique": "etching and aquatint", "support_materials": [], "department": "Prints", "collection": "PR - Etching", "type": "Print", "measurements": null, "dimensions": {}, "state_of_the_work": null, "edition_of_the_work": null, "creditline": "Gift of John Puskas", "copyright": null, "inscriptions": [], "exhibitions": {"current": [], "legacy": []}, "provenance": [], "find_spot": null, "related_works": [], "fun_fact": null, "digital_description": null, "wall_description": null, "citations": [], "catalogue_raisonne": null, "url": "https://clevelandart.org/art/1994.273", "images": null, "updated_at": "2019-12-17 09:00:21.432000"}, {"id": 157454, "accession_number": "1994.304", "share_license_status": "Copyrighted", "tombstone": "Untitled, 1992.

She began making traditional documentary photographs throughout the United States and Africa in the late 1970s. While in graduate school at the University of California, San Diego (M.F.A., 1985), Simpson began to question and challenge the objectivity of such images and to examine the ways in which these documents are generally perceived. Taking subjects from her own photographs and inserting them into stark backgrounds, she eliminated their contextual clues and instead juxtaposed her own texts and readings, often revealing racial and gender prejudices otherwise subsumed. In the mid-1980s, Simpson won international attention and critical acclaim for her series of large-scale black-and-white self-portraits. Photographing herself from the back, excluding her face and often juxtaposing the portrait with text and appropriated imagery, Simpson used her absence of self to comment on the exclusion of African Americans in history and culture. She continues to address these issues. Since 1990 Simpson has completed three related series, incorporating her back-turned or effaced self-portrait with symbolic props such as coiled or braided hair, high-heeled shoes, and African masks. Simpson (born in New York City) has received many awards and exhibited internationally. In 1990 she was the first African-American woman to be given a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She has also been included in the Venice Biennale (1990) and the Whitney Biennial Exhibition (1991, 1993). Simpson lives in Brooklyn.

Sall\u00e9e learned the building trade from his father but decided to pursue a career in art. In 1931 he moved to Cleveland and attended art classes at Karamu House, then known as the Playhouse Settlement. He studied lithography and etching techniques at the Huntington Poly technic Institute, 1932\u201333. He attended the Cleveland School of Art, 1933\u201338, studying with Carl Gaertner, Viktor Schreckengost, Rolf Stoll, and Paul Travis. In 1939 he earned a B.S. in education from Western Reserve College and began teaching art in the Cleveland school system. In 1936 he joined the local chapter of the American Artists\u2019 Congress. Sall\u00e9e worked on several Works Progress Administration projects, 1936 creating prints, then painting murals. His WPA commissions included work for Sunny Acres Hospital, the Outhwaite Homes, and Cleveland Municipal Airport, as well as the Fort Hays Homes in Columbus, Ohio. He exhibited in the May Shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art (1935\u201346), and in group exhibitions at Howard University (1937) and the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. (1940), the Tanner Art Galleries of Chicago (1940), the Associated American Art Galleries of New York (1941), and Atlanta University (1942).
